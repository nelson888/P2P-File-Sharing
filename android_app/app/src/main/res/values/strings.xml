    <string name="help_description">\t\t\t\tThis app allows to send/receive files from another device in Peer to Peer (P2P), with mobile\'s data. P2P means that the data transferred goes directly from one device to another, without any intermediate server.\n\nTo be able to transfer files, both devices need to be on the same local network.\nShare data with one of the smartphone and connect the other device to the data shared\n\nTo assure a transfer without problems, please make sure that <b>both devices have the latest version of the app</b></string>
    <string name="receive_description">\t\t\t\tTo receive a file, go to the receive screen, Wait for the app to find the sender peer, or enter the peer key of the sender device manually. Once the service started, you can the see the progress on the notification created.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFor devices before Android 11, the files are directly downloaded in the \'Download\' folder.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSince Android 11, it is prohibited for an app to access all device\'s files, so the received files are downloaded in a app-private directory. You can manage these files and move them to any directory  you want, from the \'Manage received files\' screen</string>
    <string name="send_description">\t\t\t\tTo send a file, pick one by clicking on the button. Once it is done, a key will be displayed on the screen, you can eventually provide it to the receiving device but the receiver should be able to detect your device without it.\nAfter the receiving peer will have found your device, the transfer will start.\nYou can the see the progress on the notification created</string>
